# Docker container with XVFB, FVWM2, Firefox 57+ and VNC 

This container is the baseline for some projects I'm working on.

To connect to the container, launch RDP and connect to 10389. Please note VNC has no password so please take care if you are not working a secure environment.


## to build the container:

```sh build-docker.sh```



## to run container

```sh launch-container.sh``` - defaults to codevol 


if you need another volume:


```sh launch-container.sh <volumename>```
